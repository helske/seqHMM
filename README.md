seqHMM: Hidden Markov Models for Life Sequences and Other Multivariate, Multichannel Categorical Time Series
====================================================================================================

The `seqHMM` package is designed for fitting hidden (or latent) Markov models (HMMs) and mixture hidden Markov models (MHMMs) for social sequence data and other categorical time series. Also some more restricted versions of these type of models are now available: Markov models, mixture Markov models, and latent class models. 

The package supports models for one or multiple subjects with one or multiple parallel sequences (channels). External covariates can be added to explain cluster membership in mixture models. The package provides functions for evaluating and comparing models, as well as functions for easy plotting of multichannel sequence data and hidden Markov models.

Maximum likelihood estimation via EM algorithm and direct numerical maximization with analytical gradients is supported. All main algorithms are written in C++ with parallel computation support via OpenMP.

Preview of the `seqHMM` package
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This example uses the `biofam` data from the `TraMineR` package. The data consist of a sample of 2000 individuals born between 1909 and 1972 constructed from the Swiss Household Panel (SHP) survey in 2002. The sequences consist of family life states from age 15 to 30 (in columns 10 to 25).


- 0 = "living with parents"
- 1 = "left home"
- 2 = "married"
- 3 = "left home+married"
- 4 = "child"
- 5 = "left home+child"
- 6 = "left home+married+child"
- 7 = "divorced"

For the functions of the `seqHMM` package, sequence data is given as a state sequence object (`stslist`) using the `seqdef` function in the `TraMineR` package. To show a more complex example, the original data is split into three separate channels. This data is pre-generated and stored as `biofam3c`. It contains a list of three sequence data sets and a data frame including the covariates. Find more information and the code for the conversion by typing `help(biofam3c)`.

```
library(seqHMM)
data(biofam3c)

# Building sequence objects
marr_seq <- seqdef(biofam3c$married,
 start = 15,
 alphabet = c("single", "married", "divorced"),
 cpal = c("violetred2", "darkgoldenrod2", "darkmagenta")
)
child_seq <- seqdef(biofam3c$children,
 start = 15,
 alphabet = c("childless", "children"),
 cpal = c("darkseagreen1", "coral3")
)
left_seq <- seqdef(biofam3c$left,
 start = 15,
 alphabet = c("with parents", "left home"),
 cpal = c("lightblue", "red3")
)
```

### Plotting multichannel sequence data
3
Multichannel sequence data are easily plotted using the `ssplot` function (ssplot for Stacked Sequence Plot). It can plot two types of plots: sequences themselves (index plots) or state distributions at each time point. Plotting index plots with large sequence data can take time, especially if the sequences are also sorted at the same time, so by default the function plots states distributions.

```
# Plotting state distribution plots of observations
ssplot(
  list(marr.seq, child.seq, left.seq), title = "State distribution plots")
```                  
![ssp1](https://github.com/helske/seqHMM/blob/master/Examples/ssp1.png)

Multiple `ssp` objects can also be plotted together in a grid.

```
# Preparing plots for women's state distributions
# Sorting by scores from multidimensional scaling
ssp_f2 <- ssp(
  list(marr.seq[biofam3c$covariates$sex == "woman",], 
       child.seq[biofam3c$covariates$sex == "woman",],
       left.seq[biofam3c$covariates$sex == "woman",]),
  type = "d", plots = "obs", border = NA, withlegend = FALSE,
  title = "State distributions for women", title.n = FALSE,
  ylab = c("Married", "Parenthood", "Left home"), ylab.pos = c(1, 2, 1),
  xlab = "Age", xtlab = 15:30)

# Same plot, but sequences instead of state distributions
ssp_f3 <- update(
  ssp_f2, type = "I", sortv = "mds.obs", title = "Sequences for women")

# State distributions with men's data
ssp_m2 <- update(
  ssp_f2, x = list(marr.seq[biofam3c$covariates$sex == "man",], 
                   child.seq[biofam3c$covariates$sex == "man",], 
                   left.seq[biofam3c$covariates$sex == "man",]),
  title = "State distributions for men")

# Men's sequences
ssp_m3 <- update(
  ssp_m2, type = "I", sortv = "mds.obs", title = "Sequences for men")

# Plotting state distributions and index plots of observations for women and men 
gridplot(
  list(ssp_f2, ssp_f3, ssp_m2, ssp_m3), ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE, 
  row.prop = c(0.42, 0.42, 0.16), legend.pos2 = "top")

```

### Building models

A model is first constructed using an appropriate build function. There are several such functions available: `build_hmm` for hidden Markov models, `build_mhmm` for mixture hidden Markov models, `build_mm` for Markov models, `build_mmm` for mixture Markov models, and `build_lcm` for latent class models.

When estimating hidden Markov models (HMMs) or mixture hidden Markov models, you may either 

1. choose random starting values by giving the number of hidden states with the `n_states` argument (recommended for simple models) or
2. give user defined starting values for initial, transition, and emission matrices for faster estimation process (recommended for more complex models).

See the [Examples and tips for estimating Markovian
models with seqHMM](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=seqHMM/vignettes/seqHMM_estimation.pdf) vignette for tips and suggestions on model estimation and setting starting values.

Build functions check that the data and matrices are of the right form and create an object of class `hmm` (for HMMs and MMs) or `mhmm` (for MHMMs, MMMs, and LCMs). For the latter, covariates can be omitted or added with the usual `formula` argument using symbolic formulas familiar from e.g. the `lm` function. Even though missing observations are allowed in sequence data, covariates must be completely observed.

### Estimating hidden Markov models

When estimating Hidden Markov models (HMMs), starting values for initial, transition, and emission probabilities are given in the `build_hmm` function (either random starting values with the `n_states` argument or user-defined starting values with `transition_probs`, `emission_probs`, and `initial_probs`). After that, parameters are estimated with the `fit_model` function. 

**Options for estimation methods**

The fitting function provides three estimation steps: 1) EM algorithm, 2) global optimization, and 3) local optimization. By default, only the EM step is performed. The results from a former step are used as starting values in a latter. In order to reduce the risk of being trapped in a poor local maximum, a large number of initial values should be tested. 

If global step is chosen, by default the `fit_model` function uses the multilevel single-linkage method (MLSL) with the LDS modification. The MLSL draws multiple random starting values and performs local optimization (L-BFGS by default) from each starting point. The LDS modification uses low-discrepancy sequences instead of random numbers as starting points and should improve convergence rate.

In order to reduce computation time spent on non-global optima, the convergence tolerance of the local optimizer is set relatively large. At step 3, a local optimization (again L-BFGS by default) is run with a lower tolerance to find the optimum with high precision.

There are some theoretical guarantees that the MLSL method shoud ﬁnd all local optima in a ﬁnite number of local optimizations. Of course, it might not always succeed in a reasonable time. The EM algorithm can help in finding good boundaries for the search, especially with good starting values, but in some cases it can mislead. A good strategy is to try a couple of different fitting options with different combinations of the methods: e.g. all steps, only global and local steps, and a few evaluations of EM followed by global and local optimization.

It is also possible to run the EM algorithm several times with random starting values. This is done by setting the value `restarts` in the `control_em` argument. Although not done by default, this method seems to perform very well as EM algorithm is relatively fast compared to direct numerical estimation.

**Single-channel data and random starting values**
```
# Initializing an HMM with 4 hidden states, random starting values                   
init_hmm_mvad1 <- build_hmm(observations = mvad_seq, n_states = 4)

# Estimating model parameters using the EM algorithm with 50 restarts 
# Randomized starting values for transition and emission probabilities
fit_hmm_mvad <- fit_model(init_hmm_mvad, control_em = list(restart = list(times = 50)))

# Saving the HMM
hmm_mvad <- fit_hmm_mvad$model
```

**Multichannel data and user-defined starting values**
```
# Initial values for emission matrices
emiss_marr <- matrix(NA, nrow=4, ncol=3)
emiss_marr[1,] <- seqstatf(marr.seq[, 1:4])[, 2] + 0.1
emiss_marr[2,] <- seqstatf(marr.seq[, 5:8])[, 2] + 0.1

emiss_child[1,] <- seqstatf(child.seq[, 1:4])[, 2] + 0.1
emiss_child[2,] <- seqstatf(child.seq[, 5:8])[, 2] + 0.1
emiss_child[3,] <- seqstatf(child.seq[, 9:12])[, 2] + 0.1
emiss_child[4,] <- seqstatf(child.seq[, 13:16])[, 2] + 0.1
emiss_child <- emiss_child / rowSums(emiss_child)

emiss_left <- matrix(NA, nrow=4, ncol=2)
emiss_left[1,] <- seqstatf(left.seq[, 1:4])[, 2] + 0.1
emiss_left[2,] <- seqstatf(left.seq[, 5:8])[, 2] + 0.1

emiss_left <- emiss_left / rowSums(emiss_left)

# Initial values for transition matrix
trans <- matrix(
  c(0.90, 0.06, 0.03, 0.01,
       0, 0.90, 0.07, 0.03,
       0,    0, 0.90, 0.10,
       0,    0,    0,    1), 
  nrow = 4, ncol = 4, byrow = TRUE)

# Initial values for initial state probabilities

# Building the hidden Markov model with initial parameter values 
bhmm <- build_hmm(

  initial_probs = initial_probs, transition_probs = trans, 
  emission_probs = list(emiss_marr, emiss_child, emiss_left),

hmm4$logLik
# -16856.78


```

### Plotting hidden Markov models

A simple `plot` method is used to show an `hmm` object as a graph. It shows hidden states as pie charts (vertices), with emission probabilities as slices and transition probabilities as arrows (edges). By default, initial probabilities are shown below the pies.

```
# Plot HMM
plot(hmm$model)
```
![HMMdefault](https://github.com/helske/seqHMM/blob/master/Examples/HMMdefault.png)

```

# A prettier version
plot(
  hmm$model,
  # larger vertices
  vertex.size = 45,
  # varying curvature of edges
  edge.curved = c(0, -0.7, 0.6, 0, -0.7, 0),
  # legend with two columns and less space
  ncol.legend = 2, legend.prop = 0.4,
  # new label for combined slice
  combined.slice.label = "States with probability < 0.05")
```
![HMM](https://github.com/helske/seqHMM/blob/master/Examples/HMModel.png)

The `ssplot` function can also be used for plotting the observed states and/or the most probable paths of hidden states of a HMM.

```
# Plotting observations and hidden states
ssplot(hmm$model, plots = "both", type = "I")
```
![sspboth_default](https://github.com/helske/seqHMM/blob/master/Examples/sspboth_default.png)
```
# Prettier version
ssplot(
  hmm$model, type = "I", plots = "both",
  # Sorting subjects according to multidimensional
  # scaling scores of the most probable hidden state paths
  sortv = "mds.hidden", 
  # Naming the channels
  ylab = c("Children", "Married", "Residence"), 
  # Title for the plot
  title = "Observed sequences and the 
most probable paths of hidden states",
  # Labels for hidden states (most common states)
  hidden.states.labels = c("1: Childless single, with parents", 
                           "2: Childless single, left home",
                           "3: Married without children",
                           "4: Married parent, left home"),
  # Colours for hidden states
  hidden.states.colors = c("olivedrab", "bisque", "plum", "indianred"),
  # Labels for x axis
  xtlab = 15:30, xlab = "Age",
  # Proportion for legends
  legend.prop = 0.45)
```
![sspboth](https://github.com/helske/seqHMM/blob/master/Examples/sspboth.png)

### Computing likelihood and BIC

The `logLik` and `BIC` functions are used for model comparison with the log-likelihood or the Bayesian information criterion (BIC).

```
# Likelihood
logLik(hmm$model)
# 'log Lik.' -16854.16 (df=25)

# BIC
BIC(hmm$model)
# 33967.66
```

### Trimming HMMs

The `trim_hmm` function can be used to trim models by setting small probabilities to zero. Here the trimmed model led to model with slightly improved likelihood, so probabilities less than 0.001 could be set to zero.

```
trimmed_hmm <- trim_model(hmm$model, maxit = 100, zerotol = 1e-03)
# "1 iteration(s) used."
# "Trimming improved log-likelihood, ll_trim-ll_orig = 4.28e-05"

# Transition probabilities of the original HMM
hmm$model$emission_probs

### Converting multichannel to single channel models and data

The `mc_to_sc` function converts a multichannel model into a single channel representation. E.g. the `plot` function for `hmm` objects uses this type of conversion. The `seqHMM` package also includes a similar function `mc_to_sc_data` for merging multiple state sequence objects.

```
sc_hmm <- mc_to_sc(hmm$model)

ssplot(sc_hmm, plots = "both", type = "I", sortv = "from.end", sort.channel = 0, 
       xtlab = 15:30, legend.prop = 0.5)
```
![scssp](https://github.com/helske/seqHMM/blob/master/Examples/scssp.png)

### Mixture hidden Markov models

A mixture hidden Markov model (MHMM) is, by definition, a mixture of HMMs that are estimated together. These are fitted and plotted with similar functions to ones presented before. 

Starting values are given as a list consisting of the parameter values for each cluster. Similarly to HMMs, you may either 

1. choose random starting values by giving a vector for the number of hidden states in each cluster/submodel with the `n_states` argument (recommended for simple models) or
2. give user defined starting values for initial, transition, and emission matrices for faster estimation process (recommended for more complex models).

The `build_mhmm` function checks that the model is properly constructed before estimating parameters with the `fit_model` function.

**MHMM without covariates, random starting values**
```
# Building the MHMM
init_mhmm_1 <- build_mhmm(
  observations = list(marr_seq, child_seq, left_seq), 
  channel_names = c("Marriage", "Parenthood", "Residence"),
  # Number of hidden states: 4 hidden states in clusters 1 and 2, 6 hidden states in cluster 3
  n_states = c(4, 4, 6))

# Estimating the parameters with the EM algorithm, 10 restarts with randomized starting values
mhmm_1 <- fit_model(init_mhmm_1, control_em = list(restart = list(times = 10)))
```

### Summary of MHMM

The `summary` method computes summaries of the MHMM, e.g. standard errors for covariates and prior and posterior probabilities for subjects. A `print` method shows some summaries of these: estimates and standard errors for covariates, log-likelihood and BIC, information on most probable clusters and prior and posterior probabilities. Parameter estimates for transitions, emissions, and initial probabilities are omitted by default. 

The classification table shows the mean probabilities of belonging to each cluster by the most probable cluster. The most probable cluster is determined by the posterior probabilities. A good model shoud have high proportions in the diagonal. Here, for individuals assigned to cluster 1, the average probability for cluster 1 is 0.84, 0.16 for cluster 2, and close to 0 for cluster 3. The highest probability for the assigned cluster is 0.93 for cluster 3.

### Plotting MHMMs

Also MHMMs are plotted with the `plot` function. The user can choose between an interactive mode (`interactive = TRUE`), where the model for each cluster is plotted separately, and a combined plot with all models at once.
```
# Plot mixture hidden Markov model
# Interactive plot, one cluster at a time
plot(mhmm_fit$model, interactive = TRUE)
```

![mixHMM3](https://github.com/helske/seqHMM/blob/master/Examples/mixHMM3.png)


```
# Plotting observed sequences and most probable hidden states
# Interactive plot, one cluster at a time
mssplot(
  mhmm_fit$model, plots = "both", type = "I", sortv = "from.end", sort.channel = 1, 
  xtlab = 15:30, xlab = "Age")
