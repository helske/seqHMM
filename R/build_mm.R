#' Build a Markov Model
#'
#' Function [build_mm()] builds and automatically estimates a Markov model. It is also a shortcut for
#' constructing a Markov model as a restricted case of an `hmm` object.
#' @export
#' @param observations An `stslist` object (see [TraMineR::seqdef()]) containing
#' the sequences.
#' @return Object of class `hmm` with following elements:
#' * `observations`\cr State sequence object or a list of such containing the data.
#' * `transition_probs`\cr A matrix of transition probabilities.
#' * `emission_probs`\cr A matrix or a list of matrices of emission probabilities.
#' * `initial_probs`\cr A vector of initial probabilities.
#' * `state_names`\cr Names for hidden states.
#' * `symbol_names`\cr Names for observed states.
#' * `channel_names`\cr Names for channels of sequence data
#' * `length_of_sequences`\cr (Maximum) length of sequences.
#' * `n_sequences`\cr Number of sequences.
#' * `n_symbols`\cr Number of observed states (in each channel).
#' * `n_states`\cr Number of hidden states.
#' * `n_channels`\cr Number of channels.
#'
#' @details Unlike the other build functions in `seqHMM`, the [build_mm()] function
#' automatically estimates the model parameters. In case of no missing values,
#' initial and transition probabilities are
#' directly estimated from the observed initial state probabilities and transition counts.
#' In case of missing values, the EM algorithm is run once.
#'
#' Note that it is possible that the data contains a symbol from which there are
#' no transitions anywhere (even to itself), which would lead to a row in
#' transition matrix full of zeros. In this case the [build_mm()]
#' (as well as the EM algorithm) assumes that the
#' the state is absorbing in a way that probability of staying in this state is 1.
#'
#' @seealso [plot.hmm()] for plotting the model.
