	Patterns},
  journal = {Sociological Methods \& Research},
  year = {2010},
  volume = {38},
  pages = {389--419},
  number = {3},
  abstract = {This article addresses the question of the effects of cost setting
	on the kind of temporal patterns optimal matching (OM) can uncover
	when applied to social science data. It is argued that the balance
	between indel (insertion and deletion) and substitution costs determines
	what kind of socio-temporal pattern can be brought to light. Insertion
	and deletion operations favor identically coded states irrespective
	of their locations whereas substitutions focus on contemporaneous
	similarities. The lower the ratio of substitution to indel costs,
	the closer OM is to the Hamming distance where only substitutions
	are used. The higher this ratio, the closer OM is to the Levenshtein
	II distance, which amounts to finding the longest common subsequence.
	When the timing of sequences is crucial, substitutions should be
	favored over indels and their costs should be carefully fixed. Ideally,
	substitution costs should vary with time to better take into account
	the timing of the sequences studied. As indels warp time, hence the
	timing of sequences, it is suggested to use only substitution operations
	with time-dependent costs inversely proportional to transition frequencies
	whenever the timing of sequences is central. This OM variant, coined
	dynamic Hamming matching, is applied to the question of the scheduling
	of paid work where timing is critical (1985 and 1999 French time
	use surveys, N = 7,908) along with three classical OM variants (Hamming
	and Levenshtein I and II). As expected, the two Hamming dissimilarity
	measures fare better to identify patterns of workday schedules, as
	measured by entropy, than the two Levenshtein ones.},
