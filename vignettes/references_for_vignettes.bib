  abstract = {Recent developments of life-course theory and research are discussed
	in a comparative framework. With accelerating social change, the
	life course has become a topic that centres on the interplay of personal
	and institutional dynamics through the life span that provides the
	temporal and social contexts for biographical planning and stock-taking.
	Modern life-course analysis asks to what extent biographies are losing
	their structural embeddedness in favour of negotiations among individuals,
	opportunities, institutions and social networks. First, a historical
	account about European and North American traditions of life-course
	research is presented, delineating the cohort/life-event and the
	life-history approaches. Second, three conceptual frameworks are
	illuminated that focus on the relationship between social change
	and human lives: linking mechanisms, structuration and institutional
	arrangements (with a focus on age and gender). Concerning methodology,
	longitudinal studies that use quantitative as well as qualitative
	methods are necessary to understand the interrelationships between
	social change and biography. Third, innovative themes for research
	are presented, relating to the issues of agency and institutions,
	the timing of transitions and linked lives. The article concludes
	with a call for more cross-cultural life-course research.},

	Patterns},
  journal = {Sociological Methods \& Research},
  year = {2010},
  volume = {38},
  pages = {389--419},
  number = {3},
  abstract = {This article addresses the question of the effects of cost setting
	on the kind of temporal patterns optimal matching (OM) can uncover
	when applied to social science data. It is argued that the balance
	between indel (insertion and deletion) and substitution costs determines
	what kind of socio-temporal pattern can be brought to light. Insertion
	and deletion operations favor identically coded states irrespective
	of their locations whereas substitutions focus on contemporaneous
	similarities. The lower the ratio of substitution to indel costs,
	the closer OM is to the Hamming distance where only substitutions
	are used. The higher this ratio, the closer OM is to the Levenshtein
	II distance, which amounts to finding the longest common subsequence.
	When the timing of sequences is crucial, substitutions should be
	favored over indels and their costs should be carefully fixed. Ideally,
	substitution costs should vary with time to better take into account
	the timing of the sequences studied. As indels warp time, hence the
	timing of sequences, it is suggested to use only substitution operations
	with time-dependent costs inversely proportional to transition frequencies
	whenever the timing of sequences is central. This OM variant, coined
	dynamic Hamming matching, is applied to the question of the scheduling
	of paid work where timing is critical (1985 and 1999 French time
	use surveys, N = 7,908) along with three classical OM variants (Hamming
	and Levenshtein I and II). As expected, the two Hamming dissimilarity
	measures fare better to identify patterns of workday schedules, as
	measured by entropy, than the two Levenshtein ones.},

  abstract = {Social science applications of sequence analysis have thus far involved
	the development of a typology on the basis of an analysis of one
	or two variables which have had a relatively low number of different
	states. There is a yet unexplored potential for sequence analysis
	to be applied to a greater number of variables and thereby a much
	larger state space. The development of a typology of employment experiences,
	for example, without reference to data on changes in housing, marital
	and family status is arguably inadequate. The paper demonstrates
	the use of sequence analysis in the examination of multivariable
	combinations of status as they change over time and shows that this
	method can provide insights that are difficult to achieve through
	other analytic methods. The data that are examined here provide support
	to intuitive understandings of clusters of common experiences which
	are both life course specific and related to socio-economic factors.
	Housing tenure is found to be of key importance in understanding
	the holistic trajectories that are examined. This suggests that life
	course trajectories are sharply differentiated by experience of social
	housing.},
