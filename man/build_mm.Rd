\description{
Function \code{\link[=build_mm]{build_mm()}} builds and automatically estimates a Markov model. It is also a shortcut for
constructing a Markov model as a restricted case of an \code{hmm} object.
}
\details{
Unlike the other build functions in \code{seqHMM}, the \code{\link[=build_mm]{build_mm()}} function
automatically estimates the model parameters. In case of no missing values,
initial and transition probabilities are
directly estimated from the observed initial state probabilities and transition counts.
In case of missing values, the EM algorithm is run once.

Note that it is possible that the data contains a symbol from which there are
no transitions anywhere (even to itself), which would lead to a row in
transition matrix full of zeros. In this case the \code{\link[=build_mm]{build_mm()}}
(as well as the EM algorithm) assumes that the
the state is absorbing in a way that probability of staying in this state is 1.

# Construct sequence data

mvad_alphabet <-
  c("employment", "FE", "HE", "joblessness", "school", "training")

  "employment", "further education", "higher education",
  "joblessness", "school", "training"

mvad_seq <- seqdef(mvad, 17:86,
  alphabet = mvad_alphabet,
  states = mvad_scodes, labels = mvad_labels, xtstep = 6
)

# Define a color palette for the sequence data
attr(mvad_seq, "cpal") <- colorpalette[[6]]

# Estimate the Markov model
mm_mvad <- build_mm(observations = mvad_seq)
