\title{Extract the Prior Cluster Probabilities of MHMM or MNHMM}
\usage{
get_cluster_probs(model, ...)

\method{get_cluster_probs}{mnhmm}(model, type = "prior", ids = NULL, ...)

\method{get_cluster_probs}{mhmm}(model, type = "prior", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A hidden Markov model.}

\item{type}{Character string indicating the type of cluster probabilities.
Either \code{"prior"} (the default), or \code{"posterior"}. See details.}

\item{ids}{Optional vector of sequence IDs. If \code{NULL} (the default),
probabilities are computed for all sequences in the data, unless the
probabilities are equal for all sequences, i.e., covariates do not depend on
ID.}
}
\description{
Prior cluster probability refers to the probability of sequence \eqn{i}
belonging to cluster \eqn{k} without conditioning on the observed sequence,
i.e., \eqn{P(i \in M_k | X_i)}, where \eqn{M_k} is cluster \eqn{k} and
\eqn{X_i} are the covariates for individual \eqn{i}. The posterior cluster
probability refers to the probability of sequence \eqn{i} belonging to
cluster \eqn{k} given the observed sequence, i.e.,
\eqn{P(i \in M_k | y_i, X_i)}, where \eqn{y_i} is the observed sequence for
individual \eqn{i}.
