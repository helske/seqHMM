\title{Forward and Backward Probabilities for Hidden Markov Model}
\usage{
forward_backward(model, forward_only = FALSE, log_space = FALSE, threads = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{Object of class \code{hmm} or \code{mhmm}.}

\item{forward_only}{If \code{TRUE}, only forward probabilities are computed. The
default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{log_space}{Compute forward and backward probabilities in logarithmic
scale instead of scaling.
The default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{threads}{Number of threads used in parallel computing. The default
is \code{1}.}
}
\value{
List with components
\itemize{
\item forward_probs\cr If \code{log_space = FALSE}, scaled forward probabilities,
i.e. probability of state given observations up to that time point.
If \code{log_space = TRUE}, logarithms of non-scaled forward probabilities.
\item backward_probs\cr Scaled backward probabilities (\code{log_space = FALSE}),
or logarithms of non-scaled backward probabilities(\code{log_space = TRUE}).
\item scaling_factors\cr Sum of non-scaled forward probabilities at each time
point. Only computed if \code{log_space = FALSE}.
In case of multiple observations, these are computed independently for each
sequence.
}
}
\description{
The \code{forward_backward} function computes scaled forward and backward
probabilities of a hidden Markov model.
}
\examples{
# Load a pre-defined MHMM
data("mhmm_biofam")

# Compute forward and backward probabilities
fb <- forward_backward(mhmm_biofam)

# The most probable hidden state at time t
# given the observations up to time t for the first subject:
apply(fb$forward_probs[, , 1], 2, which.max)
